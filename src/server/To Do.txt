Done!:
 - Change Index/Display_Topic to show viewcount on latest Thread
 - Added Picture Icons to User Info in Header
 - "Fixed" Icons so they appear beside threads, to display their status!
 - display_Thread updates viewcount
 - On 10 views, a thread becomes a Hot Topic (Wsa gunna make this time based, but that's work)
	NOTE, once a thread is hot it is always hot.
 - Threads created automatically get their parent topic picture!
 - If not a super topic, the topic borrows the picture of the parent. Otherwise you can choose!
 - Also, fixed header() so it works on all pages, regardless of output! Snazzy! (Probably fixed everywhere, anyways)
 - Search.php shows viewcount and icons!
